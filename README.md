# PutzplanApp

##How it works...
Is an interactive game that rewards users with points for cleaning.
Everytime a memeber of a commune cleans up a certain part or item of the flat, he adds it to his list.
Depending on the integrated reward system, he gets a certain amount of points.(and archievments)
Now the members have to keep up with the current highscore of their flatmates. 
You'll be able to share your progress on facebook and activate a function that auto-posts huge differences between the members of the flat depending on preset parameters (timeSinceLastCleanup, pointDifference(availability))
There will be push notifications aswell that remind you of your mates highscore and of the dirt-status of you flat.(e.g. 1 week reminder to clean the toilet)
